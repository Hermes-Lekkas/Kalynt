# Kalynt v1.0.4 Beta - Release Notes

**"The Polish & Power Update"**

This release focuses on a massive UI overhaul, improving the stability of the Agent system, and introducing persistent chat history. The interface is now more unified, responsive, and user-friendly.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### 🎨 Unified & Modern UI
*   **Redesigned Settings Panel:** Completely shattered the old layout and rebuilt `UnifiedSettingsPanel` with a sleek, glassmorphism-based design. It now features a proper sidebar, responsive tabs, and a dedicated "Danger Zone".
*   **Streamlined Agent Header:** The `UnifiedAgentPanel` header has been simplified. We removed cluttered buttons (model selectors, API keys) and replaced them with a unified "Configure AI" settings entry point.
*   **Compact Mode Switcher:** New pill-style toggles for "Cloud" vs "Local" AI modes and "Chat" vs "AI Scan" tabs save vertical space.

### 💬 Persistent Chat History
*   **Never Lose Context:** AI conversations are now automatically saved to a local SQLite/JSON database.
*   **History Panel:** Added a new "Previous Chats" overlay (replacing the "Clear History" button) that lets you:
    *   Browse past conversations with timestamps.
    *   Rename sessions for better organization.
    *   Delete old chats.
    *   Pick up exactly where you left off.

### ↔️ Resizable Panels Everywhere
*   **Draggable Agent Sidebar:** The right-hand Agent panel is now fully resizable. Drag the edge to expand your coding assistant when you need more room for complex outputs.
*   **Consistent Layout:** Resizing logic matches the Terminal and File Explorer behavior for a uniform experience.

## 🛠️ Improvements & Fixes

*   **Resource Monitor:** Fixed a crash caused by missing iVRAM (Integrated VRAM) stats on some systems.
*   **Build Stability:** Resolved numerous TypeScript errors and unused variable warnings that were blocking production builds.
*   **Performance:** Optimized the file watcher to prevent over-firing during workspace indexing.
*   **Security:** Enhanced path validation in file system handlers to prevent potential traversal attacks.
*   **Visual Polish:**
    *   Added missing icons (`Globe`, `History`, `Settings`).
    *   Fixed "shattered" styling in the Member Management tab.
    *   Improved button hover states and active indicators.

## 🧩 Architecture

*   **Chat Store:** Introduced a dedicated `chatStore` (Zustand + Persistence) to manage sessions independently of the main application state.
*   **Agent Loop Config:** Updated `AgentLoopConfig` types to support dynamic model overrides per session.
