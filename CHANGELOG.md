### Major Architecture Update: Agentic AI System

This release introduces a comprehensive agentic architecture overhaul with 26 new services enabling autonomous decision-making, tool orchestration, and intelligent task execution.

#### Phase 1: Critical Reliability

- **Transaction Service**: ACID-compliant file operations with shadow file system and commit/rollback support for writeFile, replaceInFile, and fuzzyReplace tools
- **Cycle Detection Service**: State fingerprinting with three detection patterns (repetition, oscillation, stagnation) and automatic cycle breaking with randomized backoff
- **Tool Cache Service**: LRU cache with TTL invalidation, file dependency tracking for automatic invalidation, and hit rate monitoring
- **LSP Integration**: Enhanced shadow workspace with real-time diagnostics validation via Language Server Protocol
- **AIME Expansion**: Expanded from 10 to 50+ supported file extensions covering all major programming languages including TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and many more

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Autonomy

- **Goal Stack Service**: Hierarchical task planning with goal decomposition strategies, dependency management, retry logic, and plan persistence
- **Intent Classification Service**: 14 task categories (code_generation, debugging, refactoring, etc.) with regex pattern matching and keyword scoring
- **Confidence Scoring Service**: Tool performance tracking with historical success rates, context-aware confidence scoring, and auto-approval for high-confidence operations
- **Learning Service**: Correction history database with pattern matching for similar errors and adaptive tool selection based on historical performance
- **Enhanced Agent Loop**: Full integration of all Phase 2 services with hierarchical goal execution, intent-based routing, and confidence-driven tool selection

#### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

- **File Watcher Service**: Incremental AIME updates with configurable ignored patterns, debounced change processing, and batch handlers
- **Symbol Service**: Comprehensive symbol relationship tracking with symbol graph (classes, functions, variables), relationship types (extends, calls, references), impact analysis for refactoring, and inheritance hierarchy tracking
- **Semantic Operation Service**: High-level refactoring operations including extract method, rename symbol (with reference updates), move symbol (with import updates), and inline variable
- **Dependency Analysis Service**: Tool call dependency analysis with dependency graph construction, topological sort with parallel execution grouping, critical path identification, and resource conflict detection

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

- **Parallel Execution Service**: Concurrent tool execution with concurrency management (configurable limits), retry logic with exponential backoff, timeout handling, and execution plan optimization
- **Context Assembly Service**: Priority-based context management with critical context protection, token budget management, focus-based assembly, and intelligent deduplication
- **Token Optimization Service**: Context window optimization with compression strategies (comment removal, whitespace reduction, summarization), conversation window management, and token estimation

#### Security & Reliability Hardening
- **Dynamic Code Execution Eliminated (CRITICAL)**: Removed unsafe `new Function()` for dynamic imports in `llm-inference.ts`. Now uses direct ESM `import()` with proper file URL conversion for Windows compatibility.
- **Shell Command Injection Prevention (CRITICAL)**: Added PID validation (numeric format, range checks) and port validation to `nuke-handler.ts`. Replaced string interpolation with validated parameters to prevent command injection attacks.
- **Safe JSON Parsing Infrastructure**: Created `safeJson.ts` utility with `safeJsonParse`, `safeJsonStringify`, and localStorage wrappers that provide type-safe JSON handling with validation and error recovery.
- **Content Security Policy Strengthened**: Added `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, `form-action 'self'`, and `frame-ancestors 'none'` directives to prevent XSS, clickjacking, and form injection attacks.
- **Extension Host Promise Timeout Fix**: Fixed promise in `extensionHostProcess.ts` that never rejected on timeout. Now properly rejects with timeout error, preventing hung operations.
- **Terminal Race Condition Fixed**: Added `cleanupTimers` Map to track and clear existing timers before creating new ones in `terminalService.ts`. Prevents duplicate cleanup attempts and race conditions during terminal destruction.
- **P2P Service Race Condition**: Added `isDestroyed` flag to prevent operations on destroyed P2P service instances, fixing race conditions in rate limiter cleanup.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Fixed all empty catch blocks across `workspaceScanService.ts`, `agentLoopService.ts`, and `file-system.ts` - now log errors with context instead of silently swallowing them.
- **JavaScript Search Fallback**: Implemented `performJSSearch()` function in `file-system.ts` with regex pattern matching, file filtering, and result limiting. Provides fallback when ripgrep is unavailable.
- **Strict Type Safety Infrastructure**: Created `electron-api.ts` with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all Electron APIs, replacing 75+ `any` type assertions with proper type definitions.

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Terminal Flashing Fix**: Fixed infinite re-render loop in `useTerminalManager.ts` caused by useEffect dependencies. The effect was updating `tabs` state while depending on it, causing constant flashing and preventing user input. Now runs only once on mount with proper initialization guard.
- **P2P Decryption Infinite Loop**: Fixed infinite loop in `UnifiedAgentPanel.tsx` decryption effect that depended on `decryptedCache` while updating it. Now uses functional state updates to avoid dependency cycles.
- **Session Sync Dependencies**: Fixed missing/stale dependencies in chat session sync effect, preventing stale closures and session synchronization failures.
- **useAgent Stale Closure**: Restructured `useAgent.ts` into two separate effects - one for config updates, one for initialization - preventing stale closures where callbacks captured initial config values.
- **AgentService Memory Leak**: Added try-catch with cleanup in `agentService.start()` to ensure YJS observers are unregistered if initialization fails, preventing memory leaks on repeated start/stop cycles.
- **NodeJS Type Fix**: Changed `NodeJS.Timeout` to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` in `UnifiedAgentPanel.tsx` for browser compatibility.

#### Major Bug Fixes (Phase 2)
- **Scroll Performance**: Added debouncing to scroll effect and removed `agent.activityLog` from dependencies to prevent excessive re-renders during agent operations.
- **Dead Code Removal**: Removed empty useEffect at lines 201-209 that was running on every message change without functionality.
- **IndexedDB Error Handling**: Added proper `onerror` handlers and Promise rejections for all IndexedDB operations in `loadSuggestions()` and `saveSuggestions()`.
- **Unused Props Marked**: Marked `currentFile`, `currentFileContent`, and `onRunCommand` props as deprecated since they're not used internally but kept for API compatibility.
- **Tool Confirmation Race Condition**: Fixed race condition where pending tool confirmations would block the agent loop if component unmounted. Now properly rejects pending confirmations on cleanup.

#### Minor Improvements (Phase 3)
- **Store Access Pattern**: Fixed architectural issue where `agentService` accessed Zustand store directly. Now `loadedModelId` is passed through proper dependency injection from React layer via `setLoadedModelId()` method.
- **Timeout Cleanup**: Added cleanup for `typingTimeoutRef` and `scrollTimeoutRef` in component unmount effect to prevent state updates on unmounted components.

#### Windows Compatibility Fix
- **AI Engine Loading on Windows**: Fixed ESM loader error "Received protocol 'c:'" on Windows. The `dynamicImportESM` function in `llm-inference.ts` now converts file paths to `file://` URLs using `pathToFileURL()` before passing to dynamic import, ensuring Windows absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Users\...`) are properly handled by the ESM loader.

#### UI & Management Services

- **Task Complexity Service**: Complexity estimation based on scope, uncertainty, dependencies, risk, and novelty factors with 5 complexity levels (trivial to very_complex)
- **Iteration Allocation Service**: Dynamic iteration budget allocation with bonus grants, early termination detection, and budget compression for well-progressing tasks
- **Progress Monitoring Service**: Real-time progress tracking with milestones, activity logging, comprehensive statistics, and listener-based updates
- **User Confirmation Service**: Multi-file change confirmation with risk assessment (low/medium/high/critical), batch operations, preview generation, and partial approval support
- **Cycle Notification Service**: UI notifications for detected cycles with severity levels, auto-dismiss, resolution tracking, and suggested actions

### Improvements & Fixes

#### Agent & AI
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for AI analysis operations
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Suggestions are now deduplicated based on action-target-description hash
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript types in mission history handling

#### Debugging
- **js-debug-dap Support**: Node.js debugging now uses VS Code's official js-debug-dap adapter instead of legacy inspector protocol
- **Improved launch.json Parsing**: Fixed comment removal to handle URLs correctly (http:// no longer breaks parsing)
- **DAP Reliability**: Added initialized event handling and proper adapter lifecycle management
- **Event Listener Management**: Added proper event listener tracking and cleanup in debug sessions

#### Shadow Workspace
- **LSP Session Management**: Automatic LSP session startup for supported languages with document synchronization
- **Language Mapping**: Added comprehensive language ID mapping for LSP compatibility
- **Real-time Validation**: Diagnostics are now requested after document changes are synchronized

#### Security
- **Event Listener Isolation**: Added event listener maps to prevent cross-session pollution
- **Launch Argument Filtering**: Non-DAP properties are filtered from launch configurations

#### Architecture
- **P2P Improvements**: Signaling server implementation for WebRTC connection establishment
- **Workspace Trust**: Added workspace trust hooks for security-sensitive operations

## [v1.0.3-beta] - 2026-02-03

### Team Collaboration Fixes

#### Workspace Sharing Bug Fixed
- **Issue**: When sharing a workspace link, the joiner would see "Shared Space" instead of the actual workspace name
- **Fix**: Workspace name is now included in the invite link URL fragment (`#n=WorkspaceName`) and parsed when joining

#### Chat Encryption Fixed
- **Issue**: Messages in the collaboration chat appeared encrypted/unreadable - decryption was failing
- **Root Cause**: Each peer was independently generating their own random encryption salt, resulting in different derived keys
- **Fix**: Encryption salt is now shared via the Yjs awareness protocol:
  - Room creator broadcasts their salt to all peers
  - Joiners receive and use the creator's salt before deriving their encryption key
  - All peers now use the same salt → same key → successful decryption

#### Connection Race Condition Fixed
- **Issue**: Users joining with a password could end up in different P2P rooms
- **Root Cause**: Password was stored in localStorage AFTER setting the current space, causing `useYDoc` to connect before the password was available
- **Fix**: Password is now stored BEFORE triggering the space change, ensuring both users join the same encrypted room (`kalynt-{spaceId}#{password}`)

### Security Hardening

#### Command Injection Prevention
- Added allowlists for safe commands in `dependencyManager.ts` and `debug.ts`
- Commands are validated against known-safe package managers and debugger binaries before execution
- Python module checks now validate against allowlist before spawning

#### XSS Protection Enhanced
- Improved `sanitizeContent()` to also encode `&` character (OWASP recommendation)
- All HTML special characters now properly escaped: `& < > " ' /`

#### Credential Storage Hardened
- Removed insecure base64 fallback when Electron's safeStorage is unavailable
- Now properly rejects credential storage when encryption is not available
- Prevents plaintext credential storage on systems without keychain access

#### Path Traversal Prevention
- Added symlink resolution using `fs.realpathSync()` before path validation
- Prevents symlink-based escapes from workspace directory
- Catches both `../` traversal and symlink attacks

#### Environment Variable Protection
- Created whitelist of safe environment variables for child processes
- Prevents leaking sensitive data (API keys, tokens) to user-executed code
- Safe vars include: PATH, HOME, NODE_ENV, language-specific paths

#### Content Security Policy
- Added CSP headers to Electron BrowserWindow
- Restricts script sources to 'self' and required API endpoints
- Prevents XSS attacks from loading external malicious scripts

### Bug Fixes

#### Offline LLM ESM Loading Fixed
- **Issue**: Offline AI engine failed to load with "require() of ES Module not supported" error
- **Root Cause**: Bundler was converting dynamic `import()` to `require()` for node-llama-cpp
- **Fix**: Added `dynamicImportESM()` helper using Function constructor to prevent bundler transformation

#### Memory Leak in Salt Listener Fixed
- **Issue**: Salt listener in useYjs was never removed on component unmount
- **Fix**: Added `saltListenerRef` to store listener and proper cleanup in useEffect return

#### FileTransferService Race Condition Fixed
- **Issue**: Rapid init/destroy cycles could register duplicate observers
- **Fix**: Added `initSequence` tracking to invalidate stale setTimeout callbacks

#### AgentService Promise Handling Fixed
- **Issue**: Timeout promise didn't properly handle abort and leaked event listeners
- **Fix**: Proper abort rejection and cleanup of event listeners using `.finally()`

#### Base64 Binary Data Fixed
- **Issue**: `storageService.ts` used `fromCodePoint`/`codePointAt` instead of `fromCharCode`/`charCodeAt`
- **Fix**: Corrected to use byte-appropriate methods for Uint8Array serialization
